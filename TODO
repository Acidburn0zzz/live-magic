live-magic TODO
===============

(Wizard)

 * Add simple package handling to wizard?

 * Add boolean for whether to use mirror as LB_MIRROR_BINARY mirror?

(General)

 * Translations

(Expert mode)

 * File selectors (preseed, splash screen)  (gtk.Entry with 'Select' button)

 * Tasks - task list sufficiently static? Probably needs its own page?

 * Dependencies between options. For example, it doesn't make sense
   to display the LB_ISO_AUTHOR etc if the ISO binary type is not
   selected.

   depends = [
       'common/LB_ISO_APPLICATION': lambda: 'iso' in self.model.binary.LB_BINARY_IMAGES,
       'common/LB_GRUB_SPLASH': lambda: self.model.binary.LB_BOOTLOADER == 'grub',
   ]

   "Hidden" depends - eg. LB_BOOTSTRAP_KEYRING only makes sense when using
   debootstrap (cdebootstrap does not have this option afaict).

(API)

 * Add build() to LiveHelperConfiguration?

     Would allow saner build scripts:

     #!/usr/bin/env python

     from DebianLive import Config
     lb = Config('.')

     lb.binary.LB_BINARY_IMAGES = ['iso', 'usb-hdd', 'net']
     for pkg_list in ['gnome', 'kde', 'standard', 'rescue']:
         lb.common.LB_PACKAGES_LISTS = pkg_list
         result = lb.build(save=True)
         print type(result), result

     # Would need some way of saving logs.
     # Reliable method of getting locations of resulting ISOs.
