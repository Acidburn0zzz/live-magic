Description: Debian Live helper programs (GUI frontend)
 Live-helper is a collection of programs that can be used to build Debian Live
 system images. The philosophy behind live-helper is to provide a collection of
 small, simple, and easily understood tools that can be used in your own program
 to automate building of a Live system.
 .
 A typical program that uses live-helper will call several live-helper commands
 in sequence. Live-helper commands are all named with a "lh_" prefix.
 .
 This package contains the GUI frontend.
