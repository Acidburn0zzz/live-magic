live-magic (1.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updating maintainer field.

 -- Daniel Baumann <daniel@debian.org>  Fri, 30 Apr 2010 19:56:58 +0200

live-magic (1.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update live-helper booleans for version 2 (Closes: #571945).

 -- Daniel Baumann <daniel@debian.org>  Mon, 15 Mar 2010 07:05:42 +0100

live-magic (1.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Correcting versioned depends on live-helper (Closes: #569204).

 -- Daniel Baumann <daniel@debian.org>  Fri, 12 Feb 2010 10:44:51 +0100

live-magic (1.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update live-helper calls for version 2 (Closes: #561712).
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.4.

 -- Daniel Baumann <daniel@debian.org>  Mon, 01 Feb 2010 04:19:59 +0100

live-magic (1.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Only delete build directory if we created it. This is not only safer, but
    fixes a weird bug where Live Magic deletes its own DebianLive Python module
    when run from Git (as that directory is considered a build directory).
  * Add missing import so we don't fail with a misleading error when GTK fails
    to initialise.
  * Revert back to using --preserve-env after reverting this in #491242. This
    seems a more robust way of ensuring that the child process can actually
    talk to X. We set the path manually in live-magic-builder to prevent the
    actual failure originally reported in #491242.
  * Update vte form_command calls to new API. Thanks to Jor <jor123@gmail.com>.
    (Closes: #533556)
  * Add support for squeeze and update "stable -> etch" in user interface and
    translations.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.2.
  * Bump Depends on live-helper to 1.0.5.

 -- Chris Lamb <lamby@debian.org>  Thu, 09 Jul 2009 00:55:35 +0100

live-magic (1.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't assume /etc/debian_version will contain the string "5.0\n" for the
    entirety of the lenny release - just check for a prefix of "5.0".

 -- Chris Lamb <lamby@debian.org>  Tue, 05 May 2009 23:29:14 +0100

live-magic (1.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use WINDOW_TYPE_HINT_DIALOG hint instead of WINDOW_TYPE_HINT_MENU to
    prevent awkward and non-intuitive behaviour when iconifying window.
    Thanks to Daniel Watkins <daniel@daniel-watkins.co.uk>. (Closes: #511632)
  * Correct (and clarify) logic of file manager fallback.
  * Re-order import of GTK and PyGTK as GTK requires that PyGTK is imported
    first. This is required for compatibility with python-gtk2 2.13 (currently
    in experimental). Thanks to Michael Vogt.
  * Add missing 'ignore-system-defaults' and 'color' constructor arguments.

 -- Chris Lamb <lamby@debian.org>  Sat, 10 Jan 2009 04:01:59 +0000

    does not open displaying target with `cd /target && pcmanfm .`.
  * Add missing ${misc:Depends}.

 -- Chris Lamb <lamby@debian.org>  Sat, 10 Jan 2009 02:54:52 +0000

live-magic (1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ensure local code copy is used when running tests.

 -- Chris Lamb <lamby@debian.org>  Sat, 18 Oct 2008 00:07:41 +0100

live-magic (0.6) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Remove "--preserve-env" when calling gksu. Contrary to #490134, the

    manually. (Closes: #491242)
